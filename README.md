# Evil-Hangman

Compiler Used:


    Windows Visual Studio 2017

  
Evil Hangman is your typical hangman game with a twist: Instead of the word being chosen at the start of the game, the "correct" word is delayed for as long as possible. This is done by the program keeping track of the users guesses, and having the option to elimate words containing the guessed letter. This happens until either the user runs out of guesses, or it is no longer for the program to eliminate words with the list of guessed letters!
